<div id="content">
<p>Version 0.3 of pepper is now available. This release features an improved
report API, a new report for running other reports from a graphical user
interface and numerous bugfixes and smaller improvements.</p>

<p>The report API has received a big update. In particular, the ability
to access and run other reports from within the current report has been
improved. Among other things, this enables the creation of meta-reports
that aggregate existing reports. These features are also heavily
used by the new GUI report.</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> This update breaks compatibility with existing scripts. However,
the changes required to make old reports working have been kept small and
are described in detail in the respective <a href="../../documentation/porting-02-03/">porting guide</a>.</p>

<p>A more detailed listing of the changes can be found in the <a href="ChangeLog">change
log</a>. As usual, source tarballs can be found at the
<a href="../../download/">Download</a> section.</p>
