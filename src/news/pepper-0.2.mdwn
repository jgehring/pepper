[[!meta title="pepper 0.2 released"]]

Version 0.2 of pepper is now available. This release
brings new and improved built-in reports, an overhauled
report API and a man page.  The [Mercurial activity
extension](http://labs.freehackers.org/wiki/hgactivity) has been ported to
pepper. The `commits_per_month` report has been generalized and renamed to
`commit_counts` and a report that dumps commit data in CSV format has been
added. The new man page is also available [[here|documentation/manpage]].

A more detailed listing of the changes can be found in the [change
log](ChangeLog). As usual, source tarballs can be found at the
[[Download]] section.

The homepage has been updated as well. On the right, the latest commits
from pepper's [GitHub repository](http://github.com/jgehring/pepper)
are shown, and the [[scripting guide|ScriptingGuide]] as well as the
[[Gallery]] page have been updated. I've added a favicon representing
a pepper box and changed some of the colors.
