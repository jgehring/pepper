pepper 0.1.2 is now available. This release adds tag access for
reports scripts and fixes several bugs. The tags and branches listing
of Subversion repositories accessed via http:// has been fixed, and the
signal handling code for protecting cache writes has been rewritten.

As usual, source tarballs can be found at the [[Download]] section.
