[[!meta title="pepper 0.3 released"]]

Version 0.3 of pepper is now available. This release features an improved
report API, a new report for running other reports from a graphical user
interface and numerous bugfixes and smaller improvements.

The report API has received a big update. In particular, the ability
to access and run other reports from within the current report has been
improved. Among other things, this enables the creation of meta-reports
that aggregate existing reports. These features are also heavily
used by the new GUI report.

*NOTE:* This update breaks compatibility with existing scripts. However,
the changes required to make old reports working have been kept small and
are described in detail in the respective [[porting guide|documentation/porting-02-03]].

A more detailed listing of the changes can be found in the [change
log](ChangeLog). As usual, source tarballs can be found at the
[[Download]] section.
