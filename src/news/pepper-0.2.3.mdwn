[[!meta title="pepper 0.2.3 released"]]

I'm happy to announce that version 0.2.3 of pepper is now
available. This release adds the punchcard report, inspired by
[GitHub's punchcard](https://github.com/blog/159-one-more-thing) and
[Git Timecard](http://dustin.github.com/2009/01/11/timecard.html).
Additionally, a major glitch preventing the
Subversion backend to work on empty caches has been fixed
([#3314428](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3314428&group_id=386093&atid=1604684),
thanks to Daniel Lynes for reporting!).

A more detailed listing of the changes can be found in the [change
log](ChangeLog). As usual, source tarballs can be found at the
[[Download]] section.
