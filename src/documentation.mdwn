#### Building the source package

If you're on unix, you should check if your distribution offers a package
for pepper first (see the [[Download]] page for a list of packages). If
it doesn't, you need to grab a source tarball from the [[Download]]
page and extract it using tar:

	$ tar xvzf pepper-0.3.1.tar.gz
	$ cd pepper-0.3.1

Next, you should make sure that all compile-time dependencies are
satisfied. In general, you'll need a C++ compiler and Lua 5.1 (e.g.,
provided by `lua5.1` and `liblua5.1-dev` on Debian). Some backends have
additional dependencies that can be found in the [README](README) file.

pepper's build system uses
[Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf) and
[Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake), so configuration and
installation is accomplished with

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install

The configuration script will print a feature summary after its job has
been finished.  A detailed listing of available backends and optional
features can be found in pepper's [README](README) file.


#### Basic usage

pepper's command line syntax is printed to your terminal if you pass
`--help` (as a main option) to the program:

	$ pepper [options] [report] [report options] <repository>

As a short example, you can generate a graph visualizing the lines of
code in your repository located at `/home/joe/myrepo` by running

	$ pepper loc /home/joe/myrepo > loc.svg

The command-line options for the current report and backend can be
printed by passing `help` as a main option:

	$ pepper --help loc /home/joe/myrepo

For example, if you want to render the LOC graph including tag markers
into a 800x600 PNG file and also watch more detailed progress information,
you will run

	$ pepper --verbose loc --tags --output=loc.png --size=800x600 /home/joe/myrepo

Some options can be abbreviated as shown in the help screen:

	$ pepper -v loc --tags -oloc.png -s800x600 /home/joe/myrepo

The built-in reports can be listed by passing `--list-reports` to
the program.  Your might also want to take a look at the [[scripting
guide|ScriptingGuide]] to learn how to write your own custom reports.

#### Man page

An online version of pepper's man page is available [[here|manpage]].

### Developers

#### Scripting tutorial

In pepper, reports are scripts written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org). A short
tutorial for writing custom reports is available at [[ScriptingGuide]].

#### API reference

An API reference for Lua scripts is available [here](api/). It has been
generated with [LuaDoc](http://luadoc.luaforge.net).

#### Porting of report scripts

pepper 0.3 introduced API changes that rendered reports written for
previous version unusable. The small set of fixes required to make
those reports (i.e., from version 0.2.4 and below) usable with the
current version is described in detail in [[porting reports from 0.2.x
to 0.3|porting-02-03]].

#### Source code repository

pepper's [Git](http://git-scm.com) repository is hosted at
[GitHub](http://github.com/jgehring/pepper) and is eager to get cloned
and forked. You can get your local copy using

	$ git clone git://github.com/jgehring/pepper
