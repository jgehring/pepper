This short guide explains the main report concepts by using illustrative examples
scripts. The API reference is available [here](../documentation/api/).


### Language

pepper's report scripts are written in Lua. There's extensive
online information about the programming language, including a
[detailed introduction](http://www.lua.org/pil/) and a [reference
manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/).


### Script layout

Report scripts should encapsulate their actions in functions, i.e. they
should do nothing unless their entry function is being called. The entry
function is called `main()`, and is not expected to return a value.

The only code outside of functions is the declaration of the global
`meta` table, which can be used to set up the name of the script,
a short description and command-line options.

A skeleton script might look light the following:

[[!format lua """
-- Skeleton script

-- Meta-data
meta.title = "Skeleton"
meta.description = "Just a skeleton"

-- Entry point
function main()
	-- Nothing here
end
"""]]


### Using repository information

Report scripts can use the global `pepper.report` table to access the current
environment. The following code will print the repository's type, its location
and the current head revision.

[[!format lua """
function main()
	local repository = pepper.report.repository()
	print(repository:type() .. " repository at " .. repository:url())
	print("HEAD is " .. repository:head())
end
"""]]


### Examining a revision range

The function `pepper.report.walk_branch` function can be used to iterate
over all revisions on a given branch. The following code will gather
information about the number of commits and the number of authors on
a branch.

[[!format lua """
-- This function will be called for every revision
function callback(revision)
	-- Initialize the author's commit count if necessary
	if authors[revision:author()] == nil then
		authors[revision:author()] = 0
	end

	-- Update commit count
	authors[revision:author()] = authors[revision:author()] + 1
end

-- Entry point
function main()
	local repository = pepper.report.repository()
	authors = {} -- Global dictionary of authors

	local branch = repository:main_branch()
	repository:walk_branch(callback, branch)

	-- Count the number of authors and the number of commits
	local num_authors = 0
	local num_commits = 0
	for k,v in pairs(authors) do
		num_authors = num_authors + 1
		num_commits = num_commits + v
	end

	-- Print result
	print("Commits on branch " .. branch .. ":")
	print(num_commits .. " commits from " .. num_authors .. " author(s)")
end
"""]]

Here, `main_branch()` will return the branch that is currently checked out
for local repositories.


### Graphical reports

Reports can use the built-in [GNUPlot
interface](../documentation/api/modules/pepper.gnuplot.html) to produce
graphical output. In order to support common plot options, it's advised
to set the global variable `meta.graphical` to `true` and use the
[setup()](../documentation/api/modules/pepper.gnuplot.html#setup)
function.

The following report plots a histogram of commits by week days.

[[!format lua """
meta.title = "Commits by Week Days"
meta.graphical = true

-- This function will be called for every revision
function callback(revision)
    -- Determine week day of commit
    local day = os.date("*t", revision:date())["wday"]

    -- Update commit count
    commits[day] = commits[day] + 1
end

-- Entry point
function main()
    local repository = pepper.report.repository()
    -- Global table of commit counts with an entry for each day
    commits = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

    local branch = repository:main_branch()
    repository:walk_branch(callback, branch)

    -- Setup the plot
    local plot = pepper.gnuplot:new()
    plot:setup()
    plot:set_title("Commits by Week Days (on " .. branch .. ")")

    -- Week day names used by Lua's wday
    local days = {"Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"}

    -- Run the plot
    plot:plot_histogram(days, commits)
end
"""]]

If you pass `--help` as a main option to the program when you run this
report, common graph options like output filename and image size will
be shown.


### Option handling

Users can specify report options at the command line after defining
the path to the report script. Option handling in scripts consists of
two parts:

* Declaration of available options using the `meta` table. These options
  will be presented to the user if help is requested at the command line.
* Retrieval of option values using `pepper.report.getopt()`. Default option
  values can be specified, too.

Here's a short script that prints the head revision of a given branch for
illustrative purposes:

[[!format lua """
meta.title = "Branch HEAD"
meta.options = {{"-bARG, --branch=ARG", "Select branch"}}

function main()
	local repository = pepper.report.repository()
	local branch = pepper.report.getopt("b,branch", repository:main_branch())
	print("Branch " .. branch .. " is at " .. repository:head(branch))
end
"""]]
