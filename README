pepper - Repository statistics and report tool
==============================================

About
-----
pepper is a flexible command-line tool for retrieving statistics and
generating reports from source code repositories. It ships with several
graphical and textual reports, and is easily extendible using the Lua
scripting language. pepper includes support for multiple version control
systems, including Git and Subversion. Using native language bindings,
multi-threading and a local revision cache, it provides fast access to
repository data.

This README file contains brief configuration, installation and usage
instructions. Additional documentation is available at the project
homepage at <https://jgehring.github.io/pepper/>.


Requirements
------------
First, you need a working C++ compiler and standard library. Furthermore,
pepper depends on the following third-party software:

	* zlib
	* POSIX threads
	* Lua 5.1

The following dependencies are optional:

	* Python development files and the Mercurial modules (for the
	  Mercurial backend)
	* Subversion development files (for the Subversion backend)
	* The standard Git command line client (for the Git backend)
	* Gnuplot (for graphical reports)
	* Asciidoc and xmlto (for the man page)
	* LevelDB for the experimental LevelDB revision cache
	* lgob bindings to GTK3 (for the GUI report)

pepper has been written in a hopefully platform-independent manner,
and should compile and run on all major Unix platforms, e.g. Linux,
BSD and Mac OS X. I'm not planning to work too hard on a Windows port.


Compilation
-----------
pepper uses the Autoconf and Automake build systems, so the standard
way of running

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install

should be fine. If the configure script is not provided, generate it by
running ./autogen.sh. Additional instructions can be found in the INSTALL
file included in the source code distribution.


Usage
-----
If you've installed pepper somewhere in your $PATH, you can just cd to a
repository of interest and invoke `pepper loc`, for example.  On Mac OS X,
you might want to use the aqua terminal driver for Gnuplot (i.e.
`pepper loc -taqua` or `GNUTERM=aqua pepper loc`).

If you haven't installed the program yet, you'll need to set the directory
of available reports via the $PEPPER_REPORTS environment variable, for
example using `export PEPPER_REPORTS=$PWD/reports`.

An explanation of the command line switches available as well as
Common usage examples can be found at the man page. If you didn't
generate it while building the software, you can access it online at
<http://scm-pepper.sourceforge.net/documentation/manpage/>.
