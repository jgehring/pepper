pepper - SCM statistics report generator
========================================

About
-----
pepper is a flexible statistics generator for source code management
repositories. It can be used to create graphical or textual reports,
independent from the actual SCM software used.


Requirements
------------
Besides from a working C++ compiler, pepper depends on the following
third-party software:

	* zlib
	* POSIX threads
	* Lua >= 5.1

The following dependencies are optional:

	* Python C API and the Mercurial modules (for the Mercurial backend)
	* Subversion C API (for the Subversion backend)

Additionally, the following programs may be required at runtime:

	* The standard Git command line client (for the Git backend)
	* Gnuplot (for scripts producing plots)

pepper has been written in hopefully platform-independent manner,
and should compile and run on all major Unix platforms, e.g. Linux,
BSD and Mac OS X. I'm not planning to work too hard on a Windows port.


Compilation
-----------
pepper uses the Autoconf and Automake build systems, so the standard
way of running

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

should be fine. You can pass "--help" to the configuration script for
a brief version of the next two sections.


Usage notes
-----------
As of now, there is no man page for pepper. However, the command line
syntax and a brief help screen are shown if you run the program with
"--help" or invalid arguments.


Available SCM backends
----------------------
pepper ships with the following backends. The respective command line
switches for the configuration script are given in brackets.

	* Git (--[en|dis]able-git)
	The Git backend uses popen() to communicate with the git command 
	line client.

	* Subversion (--[en|dis]able-svn)
	This backend uses the Subversion C API to access the respective
	repositories. All access methods provided by the API are supported,
	e.g. file://, http:// or svn://.

	* Mercurial (--[en|dis]able-mercurial)
	The hg backend uses the Python C API to access Mercurial's
	python interface directly.


Optional features
-----------------
Several additional, optional features are available (see the CREDITS
file for more information about the respective libraries)

	* Gnuplot interface (--[en|dis]able-gnuplot)
	A Lua interface to Gnuplot. Reports can use it to plot data
	graphically.
	This feature is enabled by default.

	* popen-noshell (--[en|dis]able-popen-noshell)
	A faster version of popen() for Linux 2.6. Its used in pepper
	is considered experimental, but it increases the performance of
	the Git backend.
	This feature is disabled by default.


Built-in reports
----------------
When installing pepper, several report scripts will be copied to the
respective shared folder (i.e. $prefix/share/pepper) and can be accessed
by their filename. Reports producing a plot will open a X11 window if
possible or print it to standard output by default.

Report-specific command-line options will be printed if "--help" is
being passed as a program option.

Here's a brief listing:

	* authors
	Plots the contributed lines of code of the 6 busiest authors.

	* branches
	Prints all repository branches, similar to "git branch -a".

	* commit_scatter
	Generates a scatter plot visualizing commit activity per daytime.

	* commits_per_month
	Plots a histogram of the commits during the last 12 months.
	
	* loc
	Plots the lines of code for a given branch.

	* shortlog
	Prints a revision log to stdout, similar to "git shortlog".

	* diffstat
	Prints a diffstat of a given revision.

	* directories
	Plots the directory sizes for the 6 largest directories.

	* filetypes
	Plots a histogram visualizing the number of files per type.
