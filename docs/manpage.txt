NAME
----
pepper - Repository statistics and report tool 


SYNOPSIS
--------
*pepper* ['options'] 'report' ['report options'] ['repository']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*pepper* is a command-line tool for retrieving statistics and generating
reports from source code repositories. If invoked with valid options,it
runs a *lua*(1) script given by 'report' on the given 'repository',
producing textual or graphical output.

If the 'report' argument doesn't point to a *lua*(1) report script, a
number of paths will be searched for a report with the given name (see
*ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES*). Thus, the built-in reports can be launched
by specifying their name only.  Report-specific options can be passed
as 'report options' following the report script name. To retrieve a
listing of options supported by the respective report, pass *--help*
as described in *OPTIONS*.

If no 'repository' argument is present, the current directory will be
used. Normally, the type of the repository is automatically detected,
and an appropriate backend implementation will be selected. Some
backends provide additional options, e.g. user authentication for remote
repositories. Those options will be listed if you pass the *--help*
flag as described in *OPTIONS*.


OPTIONS
-------

*-?*, *-h*, *--help*::
Print a nice help screen. If the command line includes a report script name
or path, report options will be shown. Additionally, backend options will
be shown for the selected repository or backend.

*-q*::
*--quiet*::
Set verbosity level to minimum. Only warnings and errors will be shown.

*-v*::
*--verbose*::
Increase verbosity level. Can be specified multiple times.

*--no-cache*::
Neither read from nor write to the local revision cache.

*--list-reports*::
List all reports that can be found in the current report search
directories.

*--list-backends*::
List all built-in repository backends.

*-bARG, --backend=ARG*::
Force usage of backend named *ARG*. Use *--list-backends* to retrieve a
list of all available backends.


REVISION CACHE
--------------
*pepper* uses a local revision cache, located at $HOME/.pepper/cache. It
contains meta-data and diffstats of revisions that have been requested
in previous invocations of the program.

If the program complains that your revision cache may is invalid
(probably because of abnormal program termination or power failure),
please run the *check_cache* report to fix it and remove faulty revisions.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*PEPPER_REPORTS*::
A colon-separated list of paths used to search for report scripts.

*PEPPER_CACHEDIR*::
A path that overrides the default cache location.


EXAMPLES
--------
Let's assume that the current directory is the repository of interest.

pepper --list-reports::
This lists all reports in the current search path can be listed with their
descriptions. The names from this listing can be used as the program's
'report' argument.

pepper loc::
A classic "Lines of Code" graph will be generated, with the actual
plotting done by *gnuplot*(1).  If the user is running X11, a detached
window containing the plot will be shown. Else, output in SVG format
will be written to 'stdout'.
All meta-data and diffstats fetched during this session will be written
to the revision cache.

pepper loc --type=png --output=loc.png::
The same as above, now probably significantly faster because the revisions
of interest are already cached. This time, a PNG image will be generated
and written to "loc.png".

pepper authors -n4 --tags="2.6.[0-9]*$"::
This time, the code contribution by the 4 busiest authors will be be
plotted. Additionally, vertical tag marks will be show for all tags
that look like releases (of the Linux kernel).

pepper --username=user commit_counts --period=14d http://svn.example.org::
This generates a histogram of commit frequencies for the last 14
days. This time, a remote Subversion repository requiring authentication
is being used. If a password is required, the program will prompt for it.a

pepper shortlog --branch=stable --summary::
This will print a simple commit summary from the "stable" branch to
'stdout', looking like *git-shortlog*(1).


CUSTOM REPORTS
--------------
*pepper* provides an API for writing custom report scripts in
*lua*(1). The *pepper* homepage at http://scm-pepper.sourceforge.net
contains more information about this topic, including a scripting tutorial
covering common tasks and an API reference manual.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
0 on success, 1 on failure. Any error messages, warnings and progress
will be printed to 'stderr'.
